Navier-Stokes's Cow is a simple fluid dynamics simulator. It assumes constant density and no-slip boundary conditions. And oh, by the way, the cow is spherical, frictionless and purple.

To compile you will need the Qt 4.6 SDK (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads or see your package manager).  Simply run 'qmake' then 'make in the projects root directory.
